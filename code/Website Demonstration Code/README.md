# CADLAE Demo
CADLAE Interactive Demonstration: Configurable Anomaly Detection, Localisation and Explanation Framework for Cyber Physical Systems.


## Current ToDo 
- ~~Add PCA localisation~~
- ~~Fix pretrained model loading issue~~
- ~~Add Thresholding localisation~~
- ~~Add correlation subgraph~~
- ~~Add full demo~~

- fix train model tab, pretrained option shouldnt be available (overload)
- clean up full demo 
- look into adding data simulation
- Add more test files 
- Change logic for explanation to take AnomalyDetector output as input 
- Change anomaly detector thresholding 
- Clean up all code
- Add README 
- Add comments and docs
- Change colour scheme 
- Downloadable images 
- Introduction should explain all parts in detail 
- fix links (cant do just yet)
- add error handling (should be fairly breakproof due to restricted inputs but still need to have) 
- Improve code packaging
- Add discussion for explainer section 


- Make a standardised non data specific version to use. (can be its own tab aswell as standalone app
